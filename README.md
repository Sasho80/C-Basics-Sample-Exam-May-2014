Problem 2 – Tribonacci
The Tribonacci sequence is a sequence in which every next element is made by the sum of the previous three elements from the sequence.
 
Write a computer program that finds the Nth element of the Tribonacci sequence, if you are given the first three elements of the sequence and the number N. Mathematically said: with given T1, T2 and T3 – you must find Tn.
Input
•	The input data should be read from the console.
•	The values of the first three Tribonacci elements will be given on the first three input lines.
•	The number N will be on the fourth line. This is the number of the consecutive element of the sequence that must be found by your program.
•	The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
•	The output data should be printed on the console.
•	At the only output line you must print the Nth element of the given Tribonacci sequence.
Constraints
•	The values of the first three elements of the sequence will be integers between -2 000 000 000 and 2 000 000 000.
•	The number N will be a positive integer between 1 and 15 000, inclusive.
•	Time limit: 0.25 seconds.
•	Allowed memory: 16 MB.
